        <h1> Facts we know about dogs</h1>
        <p>Dogs are highly sensory, intelligent animals with, on average, the intelligence of a 2-year-old human. They possess an
        incredible sense of smell, over \(300\) million receptors, and can detect diseases. Dogs are not truly colorblind, sweat
        through their paws, and communicate through unique scents and sounds.</p>

        <aside>Speed: A Greyhound can maintain a speed of 35 mph for up to seven miles, meaning they could outrun a cheetah in a
        long-distance race.
        Health Benefits: Petting a dog can reduce blood pressure.
        Disease Detection: Dogs are capable of smelling diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
        Drinking Method: Dogs shape their tongue into a ladle, plunging it into water and pulling it back to scoop water into
        their mouths.</aside>
